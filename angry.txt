Same old pimp,
Drake you know ain't nothing's changed with these funny style niggas
We done put on in the game
I just ask for some blessings at my grandmother's grave
And it's back to L.A.,
Open the mail, staring at the cheque
Enough to make you throw up
Man it's gross what I net
I'm with my whole set, tennis matches at the crib
I swear I could beat Serena when she playing with her left
Oh, where I reside it look like a resort inside
Nigga, where your shit from?
I imported mine
Bar Mitzvah money like my last name Mordecai
Fuck you bitch, I'm more than high
My momma probably hear that and be mortified
This ain't the son you raised who used to take the Acura
5 AM then go and shoot Degrassi up on Morningside
For all the stunting, I'll forever be immortalized
Yeah, back and forth across the border line
Hate to leave the city but I've got to do the overtime
Gone all the time, even the important times
I should let you know ahead I'm coming back on my worst behavior

Fuck it, I was wrong though
Shout out to all my niggas living tax free
Nowadays it's six figures when they tax me
Oh well, I guess you lose some and win some
Long as the outcome is income
You know I want it all and then some
Shout out to Asian girls, let the lights dim some
Shots came, I don't know where they was sent from
Probably some bad hoes I'm about to take the hint from
Yeah, you know me well, nigga
I mean you ain't the only real nigga
They got me on these white women like Seal, nigga
Slave to the pussy but I'm just playing the field, nigga
Are these people really discussing my career again?
Asking if I'll be going platinum in a year again?
Don't I got the shit the world wanna hear again?
Don't Michael Jordan still got his hoop earring in?
Man all of your flows bore me: paint drying
And I don't ever be trippin off of what ain't mine
And I be hearing the shit you say through the grapevine
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time
Yeah...It's been that way from the beginning
I just been playing, I ain't even notice I was winning
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright

I'm turnin' into a nigga that thinks about money and women
Like 24/7, that's where my life took me
That's just how shit happened to go
Runnin' through the 6 with my woes
Countin' money you know how it goes
Pray the real live forever man
Pray the fakes get exposed
I want that Ferrari then I swerve
I want that Bugatti just to hurt
I ain't rockin' my jewelry that's on purpose
Niggas want my spot and don't deserve it
I don't like how serious they take themselves
I've always been me I guess I know myself
Shakiness man I don't have no time for that
My city too turned up I'll take the fine for that
This been where you find me at
That's been where you find me at
I know a nigga named Johnny Bling
He put me on to the finer things

Then Kanye dropped, it was polos and backpacks
Man, that's when Ethan was pushin' a Subaru hatchback

Suitcase, I been living outta' suitcase
Still drinkin' Henny, if it's done, I'll take the D'usse
Oops, aye, fuck it, all you niggas two-faced

True say, I been going hard but then again
They think I'm soft, think I'm innocent
I'm just lookin' in the mirror like I'm really him
Man, I'm really him, you just fillin' in, man
I gotta blunt, can I get a light?
Yeah, I took the summer off to get it right
Yeah, I gave these boys a shot and they fuckin' failed
Niggas like "you took the summer off? we couldn't tell"
Dog, just bought a island gotta sail to it
You pick the casket, I'll put the nail through it
I ain't gotta do it, but fuck it somebody gotta do it
Hate if someone else did it, fuck, I may as well do it
Okay, I had to switch the flow up on you niggas
The shit was gettin' too predictable
The new shit is on steroids, I would never pass a physical
I got it rollin' in all kinda ways, lump sum and residual, yeah
I mean we hear about the money you be gettin' but we just never see a visual
It's our year (aw yeah), Aw yeah
I mean besides Ricky Ross, Aubrey the biggest boss here (grunt)
What's the word these days?
Buncha' niggas chasing after all these woman they don't even know
Buncha' out of season woman fuckin' off-season niggas to get last season wardrobe
All the rappers that you vouch for need to get out of the house more, they washed up

You can never check me
Back to back for the niggas that didn't get the message
Back to back like I'm on the cover of Lethal Weapon
Back to back like I'm Jordan '96, '97
Whoa, very important and very pretentious
When I look back I might be mad that I gave his attention
Yeah, but it's weighin' heavy on my conscience
Yeah, and fuck, you left a boy no options
I wanna see my niggas go insane
You gon' make me step out of my fuckin' frame
You gon' make me buy bottles for Charlamagne
You gon' make me go out of my fuckin' way
I waited four days, nigga, where y'all at?
I drove here in the Wraith playin' AR-AB
I'm not sure what it was that really made y'all mad
But I guess this is what I gotta do to make y'all rap
I mean woah, can't fool the city, man, they know what's up
Second floor at Tootsies, gettin' shoulder rubs
This for y'all to think that I don't write enough
They just mad cause I got the midas touch
You love her, then you gotta give her a world tour
Is that a world tour or your girl's tour?
I know that you gotta be a thug for her
This ain't what she meant when she told you to open up more
Yeah, trigger fingers turn to twitter fingers
Yeah, You gettin' bodied by a singin' nigga
I'm not the type of nigga that'll type to niggas
And shout-out all my boss bitches wife-in niggas
Make sure you hit him with the prenup
Then tell that man to ease up

You still ain't did shit about the other one
I got the drink in me goin' back to back
Yeah, goin' back to back
I got the drink in me goin' back to back
Yeah, I'm goin' back to back
I don't wanna hear about this ever again
Not even when she tell 'em that they better as friends
Not even when you sayin', "Drizzy, tell 'em again"
I been puttin' on a show, it was a sell out event
Oh, you need better seatin'
I didn't wanna do it, gave me every reason
The point I'm tryna make is I don't ever need 'em
Seen what you'd do for fame or what you'd do for freedom
Please, check 'em for a wire or earpiece
Please, please do not let these niggas near me
Please, think before you come for the great one
Please, who's a real nigga and who ain't one?
Please, somebody stop me
I'm talkin' ballsy and goin' wild, see
I got the fest in five days and it's my shit
Soon as a nigga hit the stage, they gon'
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
Yeah, they want it back to back
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
I took a break from Views, now it's back to that, nigga
