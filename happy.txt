I got my eyes on you
You're everything that I see
I want your high love and emotion endlessly
I can't get over you
You left your mark on me
I want your high love and emotion endlessly

Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be
Just hold on we're going home
Just hold on we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
Just hold on we're going home (home)

I got my eyes on you
You're everything that I see
I want your high love and emotion endlessly
I can't get over you
You left your mark on me
I want your high love and emotion endlessly

Cause you're a good girl and you know it (oh yeah)
You act so different around me
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be

So just hold on we're going home (going home)
Just hold on we're going home (going home)
It's hard to do these things alone (things alone)
Just hold on we're going home (going home, going home)

You're the girl
You're the one
Gave you everything I love
I think there's something, baby
I think there's something, baby

You're the girl
You're the one
Gave you everything I love
I think there's something, baby
I think there's something, baby

Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be

Oh just hold on we're going home (going home)
Just hold on we're going home (going home)
It's hard to do these things alone (things alone)
Just hold on we're going home (going home, going home)
Hold on
I'm tryin to do it all tonight, I got plans
I got a certain lust for life, and as it stands
Everything is going as right, as it can
They tryin to shoot down my flight, before it lands... before it lands

But you can miss me with all that
Diss me then crawl back
I really wish ya'll would fall back
But gettin rich suppose to solve that
And these days women make offers and who the hell am I to say (no, no, no)
My ex sendin late night text cause she don't know how to let (go, go, go)
She in love
And as for them pretty light skinned models standin in the cold aw yea they with us
Let them girls in for a drink
And I'm all in they ear
Saying she should be the one I see, everytime, that I'm here
But when I'm not really even here
Black surburban with the tint on it
Fresher than a pillow with a mint on it
The game got these old hand prints on it
But I'm a be the one to pour cement on it
Uh, and start over
And show up in the mars yellin Tux I don't really give a fuck and we're only getting older
So what I tend to do is think of today as the past
It's funny when you're coming in first but you hope that you're last (you just hope that it lasts)

Throw your one's up in the air
Throw your one's up in the air for her
Throw your one's up in the air
Throw your one's up


Hands down
I'm too proud for love
But with eyes shut
It's you I'm thinking of

But how we move from A to B it can't be up to me
'cause you don't know
Who I was before you
Basically to see a change in me
I'd be losing, so I just ignore you, yeah
Oh, oho
But your on my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind
Oh, oho
But maybe in time, in time, in time
I'll tell you


A little bit, a little bit
A little bit in love with you
I guess that I'm a little bit, a little bit, a little bit in love with you
Oh, oho

I know you told me break their hearts
But it's you I wanna take apart
And I will never ever be the first, to say it
But still I they know I ah ah ah

I would do it
Push a button
Pull a trigger
Climb a mountain
Jump off a cliff
'cause you know baby I love you love you
A little bit

You would do it
You would say it
You'd mean it
I would let you do it
It was you and I and I only
Ha, hm

I think I'm a little bit
Little bit
A little bit in love with you
But only if you're a little bit
Little bit
Little bit
In lo-lo-lo-lo-love with me


I hope they never find out
What they already know, know, know
As soon as it's official
We'll have to let it go, go, go
So we don't confirm the fling
Keep avoiding all the questions
You could teach me many things
I'm just scared to learn a lesson

The pressures on
Both hearts beat like a metronome
Both n'sync like a Justin song
Feels so right but it's just so wrong
I wonder where my whereabouts?
Where niggas that I know, tryna talk my girl out
And her friends say I ain't the one to go for
She just get jealous 'cause you always get approached more
Oh, well, tell her fall back
caught up in some more shit
tell her call back
Tell her get a man that ain't cheating on her ass
With a girl that I know, yeah, tell her all that, that
And as for you I think I know you're the one
The closest I've come
I'm probably...
You know a lot of girls be thinking my songs are about them, but this is not to get confused, this one's for you

Baby you're my everything, you're all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't ever on it
I want this forever, I swear I could spend whatever on it

'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it, 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time

I say you the fuckin' best you the fuckin' best you the fuckin' best you the fuckin' best
You the best I ever had best I ever had best I ever had best I ever had
I say you the fuckin'

Know you got a roommate
Call me when there's no one there
Put the key under the mat
And you know I be over there

I be over there, shawty I be over there
I be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there

And you don't even have to ask twice
You could have my heart, or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you were so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinking that he met you in a past life

Sweat pants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest, I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say you ain't bringing Drake along
You know that I'm working I'll be there soon as I make it home

And she a patient in my waiting room
Never pay attention to the rumours and what they assume
And until 'em girls prove it
I'm the one that never get confused with

'Cause baby you're my everything, you're all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't ever on it
I want this forever, I swear I could spend whatever on it

'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it, 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time

I say you the fuckin' best you the fuckin' best you the fuckin' best you the fuckin' best
You the best I ever had best I ever had best I ever had best I ever had
I say you the fuckin'

Sex, love, pain, baby I be on that Tank shit
Buzz so big, I could probably sell a blank disk
When my album drop, bitches will buy it for the picture
And niggas'll buy it too and claim they got it for their sister

Magazine paper girl the money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee 'cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes but I can make your pussy whistle

Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on
Double cup love, you're the one I lean on
Feeling for a fix, then you should really get your fiend on

Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make your fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot 'til a nigga hit the jack pot

Baby you're my everything, you're all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't ever on it
I want this forever, I swear I could spend whatever on it

'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gon' live it up
She make me beg for it, 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say you the fuckin' best you the fuckin' best you the fuckin' best you the fuckin' best
You the best I ever had best I ever had best I ever had best I ever had
I say you the fuckin'

I say you the fuckin' best you the fuckin' best you the fuckin' best you the fuckin' best
You the best I ever had best I ever had best I ever had best I ever had

See this the type of joint you gotta dedicate to somebody
Just make sure they that special somebody
Young Money
You know who you are, I got ya
[Hook:]
I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody in that
Well, made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thang
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure [x2]


How you feel about coming home with a nigga for the night?
If you nervous, hit the lights, I know we only fucking out of spite
Cause your man don't do you right, do you right
I could fuck you so good then I hit you with the 9am in Dallas who you like
Baby who you like


Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map
I just gave the city life, it ain't about who did it first
It's about who did it right, niggas looking like "Preach"
Open cases on me for a half a million each
I find peace knowing that it's harder in the streets
I know, luckily I didn't have to grow there
I would only go there cause there's niggas that I know there
I don't know what's getting into me
I just like the rush when you see your enemy somewhere in the club
And you realize he just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
You ain't ever worried cause he's not who he pretends to be
People like Mazin who was a best friend to me
Start to become a distant memory
Things change in that life and this life started lacking synergy
And fucking with me mentally, I think it's meant to be
Paranoid, always rolling with my mothafuckin' boys
But you gotta understand when it's yours
They don't really leave your ass with a mothafuckin' choice

I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody in that
Well, made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thang
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure

Listen, seeing you got ritualistic
Cleansin' my soul of addiction for now
Cause I'm fallin' apart
Yeah, tension between us just like picket fences
You got issues that I won't mention for now
Cause we're fallin' apart

Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no

Listen, hard at buildin' trust from a distance
I think we should rule out commitment for now
Cause we're fallin' apart
Leavin', you're just doing that to get even
Don't pick up the pieces, just leave it for now
They keep fallin' apart

Yeah, my side girl got a 5S with the screen cracked
Still hit me back right away, better not never hesitate
Don't come around thinkin' you gettin' saved
Tryna show the dogs brighter days
Got a torch, tryna light the way
Bitin' everybody, which is ironic 'cause your next album probably won't ever see the light of day
Had fans, but you let 'em down
But I guess that's how you niggas gettin' down
I'm so high up I'm like, "How is niggas really gettin' down?"
I could never have a kid, then be out here still kiddin' round
Boys playin' around, where you really wanna take it now?
I got a 150, 000 dollars for an afterparty
And I gave it to the killas just to break it down
Bring us up, I never take us down
But if you bring me up, then they might take you down
Fake fucked with me back then
But it's gettin' hard for you to fake it now
Fuck bein' rich when I'm forty, man, I'm tryna make it now
