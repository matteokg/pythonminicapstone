I'm the fuckin' man, you don't get it do ya?
Type of money everybody acting like they knew ya
Go uptown, New York City bitch
Some Spanish girls love me like I'm Aventura
Tell Uncle Luke I'm out in Miami too
Clubbing hard, fuckin' women ain't much to do
Wrist bling, got a condo up in Biscayne
Still getting brain from a thang, ain't shit changed
How you feel? How you feel? How you feel?
Twenty five sittin' on twenty-five mil uhh

I mean maybe she won't
Then again maybe she will
I can almost guarantee she know the deal

Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't see 'em 'cause the money in the way
Real nigga wassup?
One, time fuck one time
I'm calling niggas out like the umpire
Seven, grams in the blunt
Almost drowned in her pussy so I swam to her butt
It's Eastside, we in this bitch
Wish a nigga would like a tree in this bitch
And if a leaf fall put some weed in that bitch
That's my MO add a B to that shit
I'm fucked up, torn down
I'm twisted: door knob
Talk stupid, off with your head!
Nigga money talks and Mr Ed! Ya

I done kept it real from the jump
Living at my mama's house we'd argue every mornin' nigga,
I was trying to get it on my own
Working all night, traffic on the way home
And my uncle calling me like "Where ya at?
I gave you the keys told ya bring it right back"

Now I'm on the road, half a million for a show
And we...

Say I never struggled, wasn't hungry, yeah, I doubt it, nigga

There ain't really much I hear that's poppin' off without us, nigga
We just want the credit where it's due
I'mma worry about me, give a fuck about you
Nigga, just as a reminder to myself

Cause we...

Man, don't live off of the hype, bruh?
Real Ting aye!

Yeah
I pull up in Lexus' like it's '07
I just hit a lick
I got to hit a next one
Last year I know you learned your lesson
I could GPS you if you need addressing
Boss up, I'm the bigger homie
But I'm one year older than my little homie
'09 they was bidding on me
But I'm young money, got it written on me

OK now we got some action
Everything I said, it happened
That boy light as Michael Jackson
But off verses, he been blackin'
Chasing women a distraction
They want be on TV right next to me
You cannot be here right next to me
Don't you see Riri right next to me?
I hate a rapper especially
They feel the same but they hide it
They just discuss it in private
Don't get along, man, we tried it
What's the point in even trying
I hate a goofy especially
They always dying to mention me
They gotta die out eventually

I could not give you the recipe
You know the game is sold separately
Swear I just had an epiphany
It cost me 50 at Tiffany's
Shout out to Tiffany, Stephanie
They used to always come check for me
My enemies want to be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me

Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it then count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me, I'm just done in the hype
Me, I'm just done in the hype
Me, I'm just done, done, done, done, done

I don't take this shit for granted
I do my own propaganda
I feel like Juelz Santana
Leg hangin' out the Phantom
6 cold like Alaska
Views already a classic
Roy outta here like NASA
Bustin' ones out the plastic
A gram, two poppin' to fuck her
The chain too heavy to tuck it, I'm serious
I feed my family with this
So don't play with my money this summer I'm serious
I don't run out of material
You shouldn't speak on me, period
You try to give 'em your side of the story
They heard it, but they wasn't hearing it...

They feeling the way and won't hide it
Niggas done being silent
Don't get along, man, we tried it
What's the point in even trying
I hate a goofy especially
They always dying to mention me
They gotta go, they gotta go
They gotta die out eventually
I cannot give 'em no empathy
I'mma have B's when I'm at 70
They cannot fuck with the legacy
I don't know what else is left for me
After this no one a threat to me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me

Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it then count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me, I'm just done in the hype
Me, I'm just done in the hype
Me, I'm just done, done, done, done, done

eah, they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
They wishin' on me

I been movin' calm, don't start no trouble with me
Tryna keep it peaceful is a struggle for me
Don't pull up at 6 AM to cuddle with me
You know how I like it when you lovin' on me
I don't wanna die for them to miss me
Yes, I see the things that they wishin' on me
Hope I got some brothers that outlive me
They gon' tell the story, shit was different with me

God's plan, God's plan
I hold back, sometimes I won't (yeah)
I feel good, sometimes I don't, ayy, don't
I finessed down Weston Road, ayy, 'nessed
Might go down a G.O.D., yeah, wait
I go hard on Southside G, (yeah, wait)
I make sure that north-side eat

And still
Bad things
It's a lot of bad things

That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
They wishin' on me
Yuh, ayy, ayy

She say, "Do you love me?" I tell her, "Only partly"
I only love my bed and my momma, I'm sorry
Fifty Dub, I even got it tatted on me
81, they'll bring the crashers to the party
And you know me
Turn the O2 into the O3, dog
Without 40, Oli, there would be no me
Imagine if I never met the broskies

God's plan, God's plan
I can't do this on my own, ayy, no, ayy
Someone watchin' this shit close, yep, close

Yeah

Yeah, when you get to where I'm at
You gotta remind 'em where the fuck you at
Every time they talkin' it's behind your back
Gotta learn to line 'em up and then attack
They gon' say your name on them airwaves
They gon' hit you up right after like it's only rap
Jewels look like I found a motherfuckin' treasure map
And ain't told no one where the fuck it's at
Shout out to the G's from the ends
We don't love no girls from the ends
I'm gon hit 'em with the wham once again
I'mma always end up as a man in the end, dog
It's just apparent every year
Only see the truth when I'm staring in the mirror
Lookin' at myself like, there it is there
Yeah, like there it is there man, whoo
I ain't tryna chance it
I be with the bands like a nigga went to Jackson State
Or Grambling
Young Nick Cannon with the snare drum, dancin'
Watch the way I handle it, uh
Bring it to the bedroom, you know that shit is candle lit
She know I'm the man with it, uh
With the bands like I must've went to Clark, went to Hampton
I ain't playin' with it
Yeah
Halloween
Taliban, Taliban
(I'm gon' shoot you)
Yeah, jumpman, jumpman, jumpman, them boys up to something
They just spent like two or three weeks out the country
Them boys up to something they just not just bluffing
You don't have to call I hit my dance like Usher 
I just found my tempo like I'm DJ Mustard 
I hit the Ginobili with my left hand up like
Lobster and Celine for all my babies that I miss
Chicken finger, French fries for them hoes that wanna diss
Jumpman, jumpman, jumpman, them boys up to something
Uh-uh, uh, I think I need some Robitussin
Way too many questions you must think I trust you
You searching for answers I do not know nothing 
I see 'em tweaking they know something's coming 
Jumpman, jumpman, jumpman, them boys up to something 
Jumpman, jumpman, jumpman, fuck was you expecting? 
Chi-town chi-town Michael Jordan just said text me

Tell me how you really feel
Tell me how you really feel
I would ask you what's the deal
But you don't even got a deal
Most niggas with a deal
Couldn't make a greatest hits
Y'all a whole lot of things
But you still ain't this
I don't know no one
That could tell me what to do
Heard yo never claimed the hood
Hear the hood claimed you
That can't sit well
Oh well, ship sailed
Still mine, all mine
Cosign, cosign
I pull up in yachts so big that they try to hit me with boat fines
Hype Williams, Big Pimpin'
Yeah, just like the old times
Same niggas from the old days
Lot of sides on the same side
OVO we a gold mine
But I'm going to go no time
Doing plat, plat only
Boys better back off
Hall of fame, hall of fame
Like I'm shirt off, Like I'm shirt off
Like I'm shirt off shorty
Whole city going crazy
Whole city going crazy
Top 5 no debating
Top 5, top 5, top 5
And the whole city rave me
And I'm back inside a matrix
And I said that we'd make it
Aim squad with some traitors
Knew my niggas from the basement
This ain't no met-on-the-way shit
We'd really put some days in
